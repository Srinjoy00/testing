It is a simple comparison between KNN, SVM, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models on a given data set of loan records. The results:

| Algorithm          | Jaccard | F1-score | LogLoss |
| ------------------ | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| KNN                | 0.7400  | 0.7135   | NA      |
| Decision Tree      | 0.7413  | 0.7213   | NA      |
| SVM                | 0.7340  | 0.6259   | NA      |
| LogisticRegression | 0.7548  | 0.7102   | 0.4146  |

The accuracy of the final results can be improved by applying new features.
